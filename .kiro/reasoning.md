# Reasoning & Trade-offs

## Evaluation Criteria
Each option is evaluated based on:
- Learning curve
- Cost
- Scalability
- Ecosystem
- Time to market

## Recommendation Logic
- User constraints are matched against option strengths
- Options are scored per criterion
- Highest matching score is recommended

## Trade-off Philosophy
No option is universally best.
Every recommendation includes:
- Advantages
- Limitations
- When not to use it
